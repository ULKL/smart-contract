# smart-contract

## Introduction
<p>The Hydro Smart Contract is open source blockchain software developed by <a href="http://www.projecthydro.com">Project Hydro</a>.</p>
<p>Project Hydro has also created an API to interface with this smart contract: <a href="https://github.com/hydrogen-dev/hydro-docs">Hydro Documentation</a></p>


## Testing with Populus
- All changes made to HydroToken.sol must be ported over to HydroTokenTest.sol (Currently populus does not support create contracts with arguments so we must manually set the owner)
- Navigate to the tests folder in command line
- $ populus compile
- $ populus deploy --chain tester --no-wait-for-sync
- $ pytest tests/
